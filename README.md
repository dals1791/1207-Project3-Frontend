## Project Description

Our team will be building and deploying a full-stack application that will allow users to manage their income and expenses in their bank account. Their income and expenses will be visualized by a bar/pie chart on the main page. Users will be able to add daily transactions and see what their spending habits are on. Users can enter transactions based on category, cost, and even place date/time stamps for reference.

Tnis application will of course be built mobile first, followed by tablet and then desktop.

## API

Our team will be constructing our own API on an Express server. This API will have the following schema as an example transaction:

**User Schema**
- Contains user info - first and last name, email, password
- User will reference the Budget model which contains their income and how much they are willing to spend. 
- User will also reference a Transaction Model which contains details of what they spend money on.
```
User: {
    firstname: String,
    lastname: String,
    email: String,
    password: String,
    Budget: ref 'Budget' ,
    Transaction: ref 'Transactions'
}
```
**Budget Schema**
- This has an Income number for how much money user has right now.
- There is a Spend Goal amount which represents how much user is willing to spend monthly. (Not required)
- Spend Category is for which categories user would like to spend on.  (Not required)
```
Budget: {
    Income: Number,
    SpendGoal: {type: Number, required: false },
    SpendCategory: {type: String, required: false }
}
```
**Transactions Shcema**
- Description of transaction made ex: 'Sushi with family'
- Category of the transaction ex: Food, Gas, Travel, Groceries.
- Amount of money for the transaction
- The date transaction was made
- What type of transaction? Routine Yes/No? --> Routine is for bills. If user has monthly bills to pay, that becomes a routine transaction.
- What type of transaction? Expense Yes/No? --> User can spend money or receive money. If someone pays them back or the user gets paid for work, the transaction is added to their income.

```
Transactions: {
    Description: String,
    Category: String,
    Amount: Number,
    Time: Date,
    Routine: {type: Boolean, required: false}
    Expense: {type: Boolean, required: false}
}
```
## User Stories

- [User Stories](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Jt04_3x2bBOjLyEk1pWXB2FXh_d--9XjrhQ5qbZH9aM/edit#gid=0)

## Wireframes

Here are the official wireframes for our budget application. The first two links are the Figma wireframes for both mobile and desktop applications. Our architecture for our React front-end, and Express back-end are attached as well.
