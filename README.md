## Wireframes

Here are the official wireframes for my weather application. The first link is the basic wireframe on the appearance of the application. The second link is the architecture framework for my React components.

## Overall Project Requirements

The following **_must_** be met in order for the project to be considered
complete:

- Our app is deployed fully deployed (both the front-end and the back-end).
- Students include a `planning/` directory that sufficiently demonstrates their
  team's planning process.
- The repos have a README that adequately documents the project.
- The commit history of your repos show a roughly equal number of commits from
  each group member
- a `Team` page to show case each team memeber's picture, passion, and contribution on the project. 

### Technical Requirements

Two separate repo's are required for this project, one for the `Back-End` and one for the `Front-End`. They must not reside in the same repo. 

**Back-End Requirements:**

- Our back-end must be a Node, Express, and Mongoose API with at least 2
  models, more if needed, and one association.
- Must have Create, Read, Update, and Destroy functionality built throughout the
  app (i.e. You don't need full CRUD on every model, just full CRUD throughout
  your models where it makes sense).

**Front-End Requirements:**

- Your front-end must use React and leverage the backend API.
- You must use React Router to handle multiple views.
- You must communicate with the back-end API RESTfully to Create, Read, Update,
  and Destroy resources (using either `fetch` or `axios`).
- Your frontend must be responsive and work on mobile phones, tablets, and desktops

#### PostMVP Application

- Add styling to make the weather look appealing to the user. 
- Add Javascript animations to the application. 

## Front-End Components
